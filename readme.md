# GrepGrep (gg)

A [`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep)-like command that uses JavaScript-flavored regular expressions.

This is significantly inspired by, and tested against, the wonderful [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

## Features

- Regexes are expressed in JavaScript's flavor of regular expressions.
- Regexes that match this regex: `^/(.*)/([a-z]*)$`, will automatically be split into their source and flags parts.
- Regexes are always executed in something equivalent to `ripgrep`'s "multiline" mode.
- Binary files are ignored by default, like in `ripgrep`.
- Hidden files/folders are ignored by default, like in `ripgrep`.
- Ignored files/folders are not searched into by default, like in `ripgrep`.
- Searching inside a folder always automatically searches into it recursively.
- Searching using globs as targets, expressed in [`zeptomatch`](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/zeptomatch)'s flavor, is supported too.
- The sorting order of the output is always deterministic, unlike in `ripgrep`.
- The most common flags from `grep` and `ripgrep` should be supported.

## Misfeatures

- Searching in parallel is supported to some degree, but it's opt-in, since worker threads in JS are pretty bad and they end up making this command slower in many cases...
- Some flags you may be used to could be missing here, please open an issue about what you need.

## Install

npm install -g grepgrep
